#  Build a Rust Fullstack CRUD App with ReactJS, Axum, MongoDB, Docker

Note from Akhil - Don't work with this project unless you've watched all the preceeding Rust videos from my youtube series - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5dTjWUk_cPYuhHm9_QImW7_u4lr5d6zO&si=PijWdMxQwWFUE7H0

In this comprehensive project, you'll learn how to build a CRUD application with React.js, Tailwind CSS, React Query, React-Hook-Form, and Axios. In brief, we'll use CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) methods to perform basic operations against a data layer via REST API.

We'll also explore how to create a robust API that supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using the Axum framework and MongoDB. But before we dive in, let's first understand what RESTful APIs and CRUD operations are and why they matter.
